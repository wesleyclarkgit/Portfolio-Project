# Portfolio-Project
Django and Postgres


For this project I created a portfolio site with Django.  Initially I used the default sqlite database, but upgraded it to a more robust PostGres database to enable more functionality specific to job creation(such as resume).  There was of course some HTML and CSS used throughout.
